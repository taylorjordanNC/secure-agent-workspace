"""The openclaw sandboxes run the AIPCC OpenClaw image as is.

It replaced openclaw-openshell, an image of our own built on it. What that
image added is now covered elsewhere:
- nsenter and nft (OpenShell's supervisor): in the AIPCC image since 2026.9.6.
- OpenClaw under /opt/openclaw, where the sandbox could not read it: the
  sandbox policy allows /opt/openclaw (read only), not all of /opt.
- USER sandbox:sandbox, HOME/OPENCLAW_HOME=/sandbox, SQLITE_TMPDIR/TMPDIR and
  /sandbox/.openclaw/state (owned by sandbox, mode 700): made by the AIPCC
  image build. Its node is /usr/bin/node-26, which the provider profiles'
  /usr/bin/node-* covers.
- The @openclaw/openshell-sandbox plugin is not in it; nothing here uses it.
